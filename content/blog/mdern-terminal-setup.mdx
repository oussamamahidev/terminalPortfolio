# Building a Modern Terminal Setup with Tmux and Neovim

As developers, we spend countless hours in our terminal. Having a well-configured, efficient terminal setup can significantly boost your productivity and make your coding experience more enjoyable. In this guide, I'll walk you through setting up a modern terminal environment using Tmux for session management and Neovim as your code editor.

## Why Tmux and Neovim?

**Tmux** (Terminal Multiplexer) allows you to:
- Create multiple terminal sessions within a single window
- Detach from and reattach to sessions (great for remote work)
- Split your terminal into multiple panes
- Create custom layouts for different workflows

**Neovim** is a modern fork of Vim that offers:
- Asynchronous plugin support
- Built-in LSP (Language Server Protocol) support
- Better defaults and extensibility
- Active community and development

Together, they create a powerful, keyboard-driven development environment that works on virtually any system.

## Setting Up Tmux

First, let's install and configure Tmux:

```bash
# Install Tmux
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install tmux

# On macOS with Homebrew
brew install tmux

# On Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S tmux
