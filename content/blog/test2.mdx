# Mastering Next.js Routing: From Basic Pages to Dynamic Routes

One of Next.js's most powerful features is its intuitive routing system. Unlike many frameworks that require complex configuration, Next.js uses a file-system based router where files and directories in the `pages` folder automatically become available as routes in your application.

## The Basics of Next.js Routing

At its core, Next.js routing is remarkably simple:

- **`pages/index.js`** becomes the homepage (`/`)
- **`pages/about.js`** becomes the about page (`/about`)
- **`pages/blog/index.js`** becomes the blog index page (`/blog`)
- **`pages/blog/post.js`** becomes a blog post page (`/blog/post`)

This approach eliminates the need for complex route configuration files and makes your application structure immediately understandable.

## Dynamic Routes: Bringing Flexibility to Your Applications

Dynamic routes allow you to create pages that can match a variety of paths based on parameters. By using square brackets in your file names, you can define dynamic segments:

```jsx
// pages/posts/[id].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function Post() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.query;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Post: {id}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This file will handle any route that matches `/posts/1`, `/posts/hello-world`, etc., with the variable part available through `router.query`.

## Nested Dynamic Routes

You can nest dynamic routes to handle more complex URL patterns:

```jsx
// pages/categories/[category]/[product].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function Product() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { category, product } = router.query;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Category: {category}</h1>
      <h2>Product: {product}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This file will match routes like `/categories/electronics/smartphone` or `/categories/books/fiction`.

## Catch-All Routes

For even more flexibility, Next.js offers catch-all routes using the spread syntax (`...`):

```jsx
// pages/docs/[...slug].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function Docs() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;
  // slug will be an array for routes like /docs/features/routing/dynamic-routes
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Documentation</h1>
      <p>Current path: {slug?.join('/')}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This file will match any route that starts with `/docs/` followed by one or more segments.

## Optional Catch-All Routes

By adding double brackets, you can make catch-all routes optional:

```jsx
// pages/[[...slug]].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function Page() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;
  
  if (!slug) {
    return <h1>Home Page</h1>;
  }
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Page: {slug.join('/')}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This will match the root path `/` as well as any path like `/a`, `/a/b`, etc.

## Navigation in Next.js

Next.js provides the `Link` component for client-side navigation:

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link href="/">Home</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link href="/about">About</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link href="/blog">Blog</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link href="/posts/[id]" as="/posts/hello-world">
            Hello World Post
          </Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

For programmatic navigation, use the `router.push()` method:

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function LoginButton() {
  const router = useRouter();
  
  function handleLogin() {
    // Authenticate user
    router.push('/dashboard');
  }
  
  return <button onClick={handleLogin}>Log In</button>;
}
```

## Shallow Routing

Sometimes you want to change the URL without running data fetching methods:

```jsx
// Change the URL without running getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, etc.
router.push('/dashboard?page=2', undefined, { shallow: true });
```

This is useful for updating the URL based on certain UI states like filtering or pagination.

## Creating Custom Error Pages

Next.js allows you to customize error pages by creating `404.js` or `500.js` files in your `pages` directory:

```jsx
// pages/404.js
export default function Custom404() {
  return (
    <div className="error-container">
      <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
      <p>Sorry, the page you are looking for does not exist.</p>
      <style jsx>{`
        .error-container {
          display: flex;
          flex-direction: column;
          align-items: center;
          justify-content: center;
          height: 100vh;
          text-align: center;
        }
      `}</style>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Middleware: The Ultimate Routing Control

Next.js 12+ introduced middleware, allowing you to run code before a request is completed:

```javascript
// middleware.js
export function middleware(request) {
  const currentUrl = request.nextUrl.clone();
  
  // Check if the user is authenticated for protected routes
  if (currentUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {
    // Check authentication state (simplified example)
    const isAuthenticated = request.cookies.get('auth-token');
    
    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      // Redirect to login if not authenticated
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url));
    }
  }
  
  return NextResponse.next();
}

// Only run middleware on specific paths
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*', '/profile/:path*'],
}
```

This allows you to implement authentication checks, redirects, and other logic at the routing level.

## Conclusion

Next.js routing provides a perfect balance between simplicity and power. The file-system based approach makes it intuitive for beginners, while features like dynamic routes, catch-all routes, and middleware offer the flexibility needed for complex applications.

In the next blog post, we'll explore Next.js data fetching methods and how they integrate with the routing system to create optimized, data-driven applications. Until then, happy coding!
